A Weather Predictor is a  Machine Learning model is a type of algorithm that uses historical weather data and other related factors to predict future weather conditions.
There are many different types of machine learning models that can be used for weather prediction, including neural networks, decision trees, and regression models. In this project we will be using Time Series Forecating Methedology.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- This model can take in data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, as well as more complex data such as atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, and the position and movement of weather systems
- On analysis, the machine learning model can identify patterns and trends that can help it make accurate predictions about future weather conditions
- We will be using a large public dataset from Kaggle with historical Weather data of India which comes from a variety of Source, such as weather stations, satellites, and radar systems.

## ðŸ’¯ Outcomes
Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions about future weather conditions based on current weather data. These predictions can be used by meteorologists, emergency responders, and other professionals to plan for and respond to weather events.
